<p>UPDATE: Brand new design based on your feedback. Thanks!  Entering states and mileage is now easier and is all on one screen instead of requiring multiple pages and multiple scrolling bars.</p>

<p>Mileage Plus is a state mileage tracker built for semi-truck drivers, or for anyone who has to track how many miles they drive in a state.  </p>

<p>When you open Mileage Plus for the first time you can enter the current state you are in along with your current mileage.  Every time you come back to the page you can enter the state you are driving into, along with your current mileage going into that state.</p>

<p>After your mileage has been saved you can view your History of all the miles you drove per state.  Mileage is even broken down by quarter for easy tracking.</p>
