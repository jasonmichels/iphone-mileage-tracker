{"name":"Mileage Plus","tagline":"Easy way for truckers (or anyone) to track mileage from state to state","body":"#Mileage Tracker by Jason Michels\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Brand new design based on your feedback. Thanks!  Entering states and mileage is now easier and is all on one screen instead of requiring multiple pages and multiple scrolling bars.\r\n\r\nMileage Plus is a state mileage tracker built for semi-truck drivers, or for anyone who has to track how many miles they drive in a state.  \r\n\r\nWhen you open Mileage Plus for the first time you can enter the current state you are in along with your current mileage.  Every time you come back to the page you can enter the state you are driving into, along with your current mileage going into that state.\r\n\r\nAfter your mileage has been saved you can view your History of all the miles you drove per state.  Mileage is even broken down by quarter for easy tracking.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
