Every time you come back to the page you can enter the state you are driving into, along with your current mileage going into that state.\r\n\r\nAfter your mileage has been saved you can view your History of all the miles you drove per state.  Mileage is even broken down by quarter for easy tracking.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
